Forecasting Stock Price Movements from Company Disclosures

In this thesis, official company disclosures (8-K filings) are analyzed to make predictions about US stock price movements.

Research question 1:
Can we predict the direction of stock price movements after the company disclosures?

Research question 2:
How does the prediction performance change after including other features such as company size, industry, and volatility index in the model?

Research question 3:
Which machine learning models and pre-processing steps yield better performance in capturing the relationship between company disclosures and stock prices?

Findings suggest that we can predict direction of stock prices after event disclosures, and predictive performance does increase with the inclusion of additional features.
