Forecasting Stock Price Movements from Company Disclosures

In this thesis, official company disclosures (8-K filings) are analyzed to make predictions about US stock price movements.

Research question 1:
Can we predict the direction of stock price movements after the company disclosures?

Research question 2:
How does the prediction performance change after including other features such as company size, industry, and daily volatility index in the model?

Findings suggest that we can predict direction of stock prices after event disclosures, and predictive performance does increase with the inclusion of additional features.
